# Bootstrap, Templates, and Building your Startup Landing Page

## Evolving Technology

Developers need to keep learning or they fall behind. If someone stopped following latest practices a few years ago, they will be much further behind someone learning fresh today. It is good to know generally how older technologies worked, but don't need to be an expert on them to become a good developer.

Code does not only need to be written, but also needs to be maintained, updated, refactored.

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap was created to be a fast way to get a site up with CSS and JavaScript.

Including the bootstrap CSS and JS via their CDN links, you can very quickly add different components to a website. From there, you can also add your own CSS to override any default bootstrap styles.

Bootstrap was really popular in its day because it provided many different layouts in a world before Flexbox. It had different size grids based on screen size, and let you divide content up into 12 portions across that width.
