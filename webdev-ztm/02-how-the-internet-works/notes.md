## Browsing the Web

1. You ask browser for google.com
2. Your computer asks ISP, which asks DNS server
3. DNS responds with google's IP
4. Your computer requests google's IP, which reaches google's servers
5. Google replies by sending the html, css, javascript (etc) files you requested
6. Your browser interprets these files and shows them to you
