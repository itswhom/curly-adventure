# HTML Forms

Each `form` tag contains individual form elements, such as:
 * text
 * email
 * password
 * date
 * radio
 * checkbox
 * submit
 * reset

There are also other form elements, such as:

 * select



## Query Strings

Adding a `name=""` to a form tag results in submitting a query string. A query string might look like:

    `http://127.0.0.1:3000/webdev-ztm/05-HTML-forms/register.html?firstname=first&lastname=last&email=myemail%40this.net&password=asdfasdf&birthday=2022-09-06&gender=Female&dog=on&cars=audi`

Form default uses `method="GET"` which has the URL including names. Alternative is `method="POST"` which puts the form data in the body of the request.

## More HTML Tags

`div` is good for setting up blocks of content to format with CSS.

`span` is for setting up inline content that can be formatted with CSS.

## HTML vs HTML 5

HTML 5 adds semantic elements to help crawlers find relevant information on websites.

 * Semantic Elements
   * `article`
   * `aside`
   * `details`
   * `figcaption`
   * `figure`
   * `footer`
   * `header`
   * `main`
   * `mark`
   * `nav`
   * `section`
   * `summary`
   * `time`

Semantic web is still fairly new. Hard to prove it has good SEO performance.
